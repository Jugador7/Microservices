Createn an app composed off:
1. Many loosely coupled
2. Independently deployable 
3. Smaller services

Each services has its own stack
Components commmmunicate with one and other via REST API, event streaming and message broker
Functional segregation (bounded context)

Benefits of microservices
- No interdependency = Easy updates
- Different stack = varied expertise
- Smmaller components = scale independently

Horizontal scaling (scaling out)
Event driven scaling with mmmessage brokers
